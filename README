In this repository you can find the ROS drivers to connect the robotic arm both via USB cable and Bluetooth.

For the BLuetooth connection please use the following command to pair the arbotix microcontroller with the computer:


`hcitool dev` -> Get Bluetooth device name (e.g. `hci0`)
`hcitool scan` -> Search for available bluetooth devices to pair with (e.g. `00:07:80:42:04:1E`)
bluez-simple-agent <bluetooth-device-name> <bluetooth device to pair with> (e.g. `bluez-simple-agent hci0 00:07:80:42:04:1E`

Establish serial connection:
`sudo rfcomm bind <port-number> <bluetooth device to pair with>`

-> Interface to device: /dev/rfcomm<port-number>

Unestablish serial connection:
sudo rfcomm release <port-number>
